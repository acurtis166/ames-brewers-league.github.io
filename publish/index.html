<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr>

<p class="mt-3">
    We are a diverse group of brewers, young to old,
    extract to all-grain, that enjoy brewing and drinking
    quality beer. As a club, we have regular meetings
    monthly at
    <b>7:00 PM</b>
    on the
    <b>2nd Tuesday of the month</b> at
    <b>
        Morning Bell Coffee Roasters (111 Main Street)
    </b> in Ames, IA. Everyone is welcome to the monthly meetings.
</p>

<p>
    We begin our monthly meetings by addressing outstanding club
    business and introducing new discussion topics. After business
    discussion and member announcements, we move into the competition
    portion of the meeting. Monthly brewer competitions center
    around a particular set of styles in order for members to
    experience and judge beers of closely-related categories.
    Any attending member is welcome to submit a beer, mead, or
    cider into the competition, provided that it falls under
    the list of acceptable styles for the given month. All
    members participate as judges for the submissions, evaluating
    and scoring each entry according to the guidelines for the declared style.
</p>
<p>
    From a brewer's standpoint, the competitions provide a way to
    receive feedback from tasters of various experience levels.
    As an added challenge, each month the evaluated brewers are
    awarded points based on their placement in the competition.
    First place is awarded 3 points, second place 2 points, third
    place 1 point, and remaining participants 0.5 point. The brewer
    with the most cumulative points at the end of the calendar year
    is deemed the "Brewer of the Year" for the Ames Brewers League.
</p>
<p>
    As judges for the competitions, we are challenged to analyze
    submissions and evaluate subtle differences between beers.
    This practice encourages us to observe, smell, and taste samples
    critically. Additionally, competitions help member-judges to
    recognize characteristics of and develop an appreciation for
    various beer styles. Evaluation also gives members who are training
    to become certified beer judges practice in distinguishing and
    differentiating the various flavor, aroma and appearance
    characteristics of the style being judged.
</p>
<p>
    <span>We follow the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines. Find out more about the BJCP and see
