## About

This repository includes code for the Ames Brewers League website. The website's purpose is to inform potential new members about the group as well as provide a medium for meeting minutes and competition results to be shared.

Meetings take place monthly and the website is updated when those meeting minutes are available.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ames-brewers-league/ames-brewers-league.github.io.git
```

- Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation you will have the option to add Python to your `PATH` environment variable. The remaining steps assume you have done so.

- Create a virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

```

- Install dependencies
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --update
```

- Save the JSON configuration file as `config.json` into the root of the repository. It should have the following structure.
```json
{
    "competitions": "path/to/competitions.csv",
    "entries": "path/to/entries.csv",
    "minutes": "path/to/minutes",

    },

]
```

## Monthly Update

- Create a PDF of the meeting minutes.

- Name the file according to the year and month of the meeting, e.g. `2023-03.pdf`.

- Add to or update the `competitions.csv` file, if necessary.

- Append the brewer submissions for the month to the `entries.csv` file.

Windows
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

MacOS/Linux
```shell
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

- Run the static site generator script.

```shell
python generate.py
```

- Review the `publish` directory to make sure that files were generated. If you use VS code you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to preview the site before pushing to the web server. You may need to adjust the extension settings to set the `publish` directory as the web root.
